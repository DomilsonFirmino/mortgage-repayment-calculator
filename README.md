## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form.
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete.
- Complete the form only using their keyboard.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend tooling
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

- Managing form inputs and validation in React.
- Building responsive layouts with TailwindCSS.
- Structuring and organizing a React project with TypeScript.

Here is an example of the TypeScript logic I implemented:

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore advanced form validation techniques with libraries like React Hook Form or Formik.
- Enhance accessibility by adding better ARIA roles and testing with screen readers.
- Add testing coverage using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation helped clarify component structure and state management.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This was invaluable for building responsive layouts efficiently.
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - Helped refine my understanding of TypeScript features and types.
